Hello there! 

In DreamKitchen folder you can find APK file, which can be put on your android mobile device. After doing that you can launch a
game and complete tutorial. 

You don't need anything except mouse to play our game. It is early version of the game, so don't be strict.

Enjoy your player experience.

Also in the DreamKitchen folder are all solution files. So if you want to get to all the files you will need to open it
with Unity.
